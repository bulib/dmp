## Roles and responsibilities

> The Data Management Plan should outline the rights and obligations of all parties with respect to their roles and responsibilities in the management and retention of research data. It should also consider changes to roles and responsibilities that will occur should a project director or co-project director leave the institution or project.

This data management plan will be implemented and managed by Eric Kaltman, under the project supervision of Noah Wardrip-Fruin. Christy Caldwell will assist with transferring data to the University of California Curation Center (UC3). UC3 will have long-term responsibility for the permanent storage needs of the data. All transferred data will be made publically accessible.

## Expected data

> The Data Management Plan should describe the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project. It should then describe the expected types of data to be retained.

We are developing an approach to preserving software objects. Therefore, our data is at two levels: theobjects we are preserving, and the documentation of the preservation process.The data from preservation objects will include:&bull; interview transcripts from Prom Week team members&bull; text files of correspondence, notes, academic papers and planning documentation from thedevelopment history of Prom Week&bull; text descriptions of objects such as physical prototypes created in the process of Prom Week&rsquo;sdevelopment&bull; software code from previous versions and final version of Prom WeekThe documentation of the preservation process will be:&bull; text file of academic paper or reportThe data will be gathered through the preservation process of appraisal.During the project's lifetime, software code will be stored on the UCSC Code Repository that is backed upnightly. Other documentation (text files and transcripts) will be stored on Library servers with nightly backups. Notes documenting the preservation process will be made using a cloud document, downloaded andbacked up on a Library computer weekly.

## Period of data retention

> NEH is committed to timely and rapid data distribution. However, it recognizes that types of data can vary widely and that acceptable norms also vary by discipline. It is strongly committed, however, to the underlying principle of timely access. In their DMP applicants should address how timely access will be assured.

All relevant data will be deposited Merritt Repository Service from the University of California Curation Center (UC3) for long-term storage upon completion of the project study. Once data is transferred to Merritt, all data will be made publically available immediately. No data will need to be retained for other purposes.

## Data formats and dissemination

> The Data Management Plan should describe data formats, media, and dissemination approaches that will be used to make data and metadata available to others. Policies for public access and sharing should be described, including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements. Research centers and major partnerships with industry or other user communities must also address how data are to be shared and managed with partners, center members, and other major stakeholders.

The metadata that will be used for this project is, indeed, a major crux of this preservation project itself.Software code will need adequate metadata wrapping to ensure that either it can be migrated to another coding language, or there can be an emulation solution for future use. The metadata must be complete enough to include technical details, contextual story-lines, user behavior assumptions, and structural information. Metadata for interactive software objects such as video games is nascent. Using metadata recommendations from the projects Preserving Virtual Worlds I and II, this project plans to employ OWL ontology with METS and OAI-ORE schema to sufficiently provide the detailed information required for wrapping this type of software code.Other data formats will be text files from interview transcripts, planning documents and academic papers. These will use METS schema to sufficiently enhance discoverability.With this metadata wrapping, the UC3 managed Merritt Repository Service will allow easy sharing and accessibility.Interviews will be for historical purposes only and conducted to Oral History Association standards. No human subjects are used for research purposes for this project; therefore there are no IRB Protocol obligations.

## Data storage and preservation of access

> The Data Management Plan should describe physical and cyber resources and facilities that will be used for the effective preservation and storage of research data. These can include third party facilities and repositories."

All public data will be deposited in the Merritt Repository Service from the University of California Curation Center (UC3) that has capabilities to manage, archive and share digital content. Merritt allows access to the public via persistent URLs, provides tools for long-term data management, and permits permanent storage options. Merritt has built-in contingencies for disaster recovery including redundancy and recovery plans.
