## Data Types, Formats, Standards and Capture Methods

> Example funder prompts: 
What data outputs will your research generate? Outline volume, type, content, quality and format of the final dataset

Outline the metadata, documentation or other supporting material that should accompany the data for it to be interpreted correctly.

What standards and methodologies will be utilised for data collection and management?

State the relationship to other data available in public repositories e.g. existing data sources that will be used by the research project; gaps between available data and that required for the research; the added value that new data would provide in relation to existing data.

Much has been written about scholarly publishing and the costs of producing journals and books. The studies have most often focused on how much is spent by publishers and producers of print and online scholarly resources, or the costs to purchasers, particularly libraries.But what of the creator of these scholarly works?There is a confused mix of charges and costs for authors of scholarly works. With the rise of open access options the Article or Book Processing fee has added to this complex set of financial issues.The study is designed to answer two questions about the authors of scholarly works in Australia:To establish the revenue from scholarly publishing experienced by Australian researchers &ndash; including monographs, articles and other forms of scholarly publication.To establish the costs (payments made) by these authors.The data is collected through an online survey tool https://evaluations.anu.edu.au/evasys/online.php?p=F8PD2. It includes:data from respondents (approximately 150 were completed the survey)data for the details of the respondents (stored separately)the survey results in CSV and PDF formats.The data will be made available through an ANU digital collection with details of the questions and responses to the questions in CSV and PDF formats.

## Ethics and Intellectual Property

> Example funder prompts:

Demonstrate that you have sought advice on and addressed all copyright and rights management issues that apply to the resource.

Make explicit mention of consent, confidentiality, anonymisation and other ethical considerations, where appropriate.

Are any restrictions on data sharing required â€“ for example to safeguard research participants or to gain appropriate intellectual property protection?

Participants in the survey were provided with information that advises that the data will be sued in an aggregated manner for publications and reports. The demographic data about participants is stored separately to the survey data.The data collected does not contain information from participants that copyright applies to, other than comments which will be used within the permission provided by participants through participation in the survey.Human ethics approval was not required for the survey because the information was collected from employees of the university and personal information was not collected.

## Access, Data Sharing and Reuse

> Example funder prompts:

What are the further intended and/or foreseeable research uses for the completed dataset(s)?

How you will make the resource accessible to the potential audience(s) identified? Where will you make the data available? How will other researchers be able to access the data? Will a data sharing agreement be required? What is the timescale for public release of the data?

State any expected difficulties in data sharing, along with causes and possible measures to overcome these difficulties.

How will data sharing provide opportunities for coordination or collaboration?

The data will be used to provide a report which will be made available to the university community in Australia on payments for publishing for scholarly authors. Access will be provided to the data as part of the reporting process.The data will be openly available. Researchers and policy makers will be able to access the data through an ANU digital repository.In respect to identifying the potential audiences the following have been identified: all Australian university libraries, university copyright officers, Universities Australia, the Australian Digital Alliance and Australian Libraries Copyright Committee.The data will provide the opportunity for collaboration with the ARC funded project &ldquo;The Australian Book Industry: Authors, publishers and readers in a time of change&rdquo; (see http://www.businessandeconomics.mq.edu.au/our_departments/Economics/econ_research/reach_network/book_project/authors/3_Authors_Income.pdf).The citation for data will be provided as a part of the report to ensure it is correctly cited.

## Short-Term Storage and Data Management

> Example funder prompts: 

Describe the planned quality assurance and back-up procedures [security/storage].

Specify the responsibilities for data management and curation within research teams at all participating institutions.

The data will be stored in a system which regular back up (daily) and integrity checking reporting. It will be stored on site at ANU with curation under the open research team. It will not be distributed to other institutions for storage.

## Deposit and Long-Term Preservation

> Example funder prompts:

Identify which of the data sets produced are considered to be of long-term value.

Outline the plans for preparing and documenting data for preservation and sharing.

Explain your archiving/preservation plan to ensure the long-term value of key datasets.

The data set will be stored in the repository and managed as part of the ANU's digital collection. The preservation/archiving strategy will be that of the digital repository.

## Resourcing

> Example prompts:

What resources will you require to deliver your plan?

Outline additional hardware, software and technical expertise, support and training that is likely to be required and how it will be acquired.

There are no additional resources requried to deliver the plan.
