## Data sharing plan

> Investigators seeking $500,000 or more in direct costs in any year should include a description of how final research data will be shared, or explain why data sharing is not possible.

The data products will be generated twice during this project.For each department in the various schools we will produce a test version of the data around the midpoint of the projectct and a final version at the end of the project.The test version will be made available to modelling and applications teams for evaluation and the final version archived for long term data management.During the course of the project we will generate daily back ups of the data files that will be retained by Meru University Statistics Club in the University's e-resources library.The whole process will take five months and after the analysis the data will be availed to the public at the e-resources library in form of pdf files and also at the club's official website.(www.muststatclub.co.ke).The data sharing agreement states that any parties in need of such data can access it with compliance to copyright laws.

## Additional data sharing requirements

> More stringent data management and sharing requirements may be required in specific NIH Funding Opportunity Announcements. Principal Investigators must discuss how these requirements will be met in their Data Sharing Plans.

This data can be shared with other statistical tools such as the Statistical Package for Social Scientists(SPSS) and SAS.
