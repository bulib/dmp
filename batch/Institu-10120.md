## Roles and responsibilities

> Roles and responsibilities of project or institutional staff in the management and retention of research data

Luis Meza is the owner and sole project manager for this project.All data collection and archiving will done by me.Adherence to this data plan will be tracked by checking records kept at public locations like OSF.ioAll information gathered will belong to the institution I currently am working with, in this case NMSU

## Type of data and format to be shared

> The DSP (Data Sharing Plan) should describe the types of data to be produced in the course of the project and shared. It should then describe the expected formats of the final dataset

Within the context of this study, I would expect to track student progress in the form of formal quizzes and hands on lab assignments. Time studies and practical exercises to determine knowledge base improvements will also play a large factor on results obtained. The measurement of knowledge is something many times overlooked and hard to determine by standardized tests. By changing projects from one semester to the next, while keeping the practical exercises similar, the possibility for cheating on individual performance is minimized.

## Documentation to be provided

> Documentation that provides all the information necessary for other researchers to use the data must be prepared 

Many of the written test results will be in the form of multiple choice test. This is done because much of the technical material covered comes with standardized tests that are used to credential and certify students at the national level.Many of the hands on performance based results will come in the form of project check sheets meeting minimum performance standards. This too is done this way to meet certification requirements at the national level.

## Confidentiality of data 

> Procedures for managing and for maintaining the confidentiality of the data to be shared

Participants in this study are students and their identities will not be available to anyone other than myself. Results of study will only be made available as participant number with no way of tracing identity of individual.

## Expected schedule for data sharing 

> Timely data sharing is important to the scientific process. IES thus expects that data will be shared no later than when the main findings from the final study dataset are published.

To date, I do not see any restrictions on the sharing of results, but the contents of proprietary tests written by the authors of the national certification tests given will not be made available.

## Method of data sharing

> Method of data sharing (e.g., provided by the Principal Investigator, through a data archive)

I plan on using OSF.io as the main repository of the metadata/documentation submitted in hopes that others can see my results and possibly provide feedback. Perhaps with each iteration of the process an improvement on performance by both the students and process can be obtained.

## Data sharing agreement

> Discuss whether or not a data sharing agreement that specifies conditions under which the data will be shared is required.

Most, if not all of the data results will be made available for public scrutiny in hope that an improvement on student success will also result in an increase to student retention.

## Circumstances that prevent sharing

> Discuss any circumstances that prevent all or some of the data from being shared. This includes data that may fall under multiple statutes and, hence, must meet the confidentiality requirements for each applicable statute  (e.g., data covered by Common Rule for Protection of Human Subjects, FERPA and HIPAA).

In the event data sharing is restricted because of proprietary licensing, the study test results will be made available and an explanation made available to this.
