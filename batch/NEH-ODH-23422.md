## Roles and responsibilities

> The Data Management Plan should outline the rights and obligations of all parties with respect to their roles and responsibilities in the management and retention of research data. It should also consider changes to roles and responsibilities that will occur should a project director or co-project director leave the institution or project.

Anyone may participate in the Betts-Reynolds genealogy project. All contributions are to be submitted to the main researcher for verification. The main researcher is responsible for collecting, maintaining, curating, and archiving data.

## Expected data

> The Data Management Plan should describe the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project. It should then describe the expected types of data to be retained.

Text files, photographs, tax forms, military records, marriage licenses, correspondence, obituaries, birth notices, cemetery records, census records, ship logs, newspaper articles, and other historical documents.

## Period of data retention

> NEH is committed to timely and rapid data distribution. However, it recognizes that types of data can vary widely and that acceptable norms also vary by discipline. It is strongly committed, however, to the underlying principle of timely access. In their DMP applicants should address how timely access will be assured.

Indefinitely.

## Data formats and dissemination

> The Data Management Plan should describe data formats, media, and dissemination approaches that will be used to make data and metadata available to others. Policies for public access and sharing should be described, including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements. Research centers and major partnerships with industry or other user communities must also address how data are to be shared and managed with partners, center members, and other major stakeholders.

The chosen file formats will be text and JPEG. Metadata from the Library of Congress Subject Headings and personal choice of the head researcher will be written within the text and JPEG properties. The data will be available on family history websites with no permissions necessary beyond access to the site. Extremely sensitive information will not be included such as social security numbers, addresses, or telephone numbers of family members, although email addresses will be available for those who wish to include them.

## Data storage and preservation of access

> The Data Management Plan should describe physical and cyber resources and facilities that will be used for the effective preservation and storage of research data. These can include third party facilities and repositories."

The data will be kept on ancestry.com and any other genealogy website that proves to be valuable. Back up storage will be on one main computer, two external hard drives, and Carbonite indefinitely. Data selected for inclusion must pass a verification process and will be considered part of the body of work that will be preserved indefinitely. Metadata tagging will be used to make the data easier to access. Related maps and historical information for locations involved will be added to the genealogical data.
