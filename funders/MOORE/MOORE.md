Data description
----------------

As part of the GBMF grant development process, potential grantees are required to develop a Data Management and Sharing Plan (the Plan) with their GBMF program officer. In these cases, before submitting a final grant proposal to the Foundation for approval, both the potential grantee and the GBMF Grant Lead must approve a final version of the Plan that is consistent with the Foundation’s Data Sharing Philosophy. Any exceptions to the Data Sharing Philosophy must be clearly articulated in the Plan and approved by the Grant Lead. Funds needed for data sharing and management may be requested as part of the proposal. Once finalized, the Plan will be referenced in the Grant Award Letter Agreement of approved grants.

-   What data will be collected during this project?

-   How many different data formats are anticipated? Please list formats.

-   When will the data be collected, when will they be entered into electronic databases, and what databases will harbor the data?

-   Does this project involve organization or analysis of pre-existing data, and what are the data sharing arrangements for these data?

-   What are the anticipated data products (e.g., databases, analyses, tools)?

-   What kinds of metadata will be associated with the data?

-   Who is the owner of the data?

-   Where (physically) will the data be stored?

-   What type of data access or data distribution mechanism and software will be used?

-   Will the location or software for initial data entry differ from the data archive?

-   How will metadata be stored, and what provisions will be made to enable metadata searching capability?

-   Who will be responsible for entering and maintaining data archives, and over what period of time will archives be maintained?

-   What data quality controls and assurances will be provided?

-   Who will contribute to the database?

-   Will proprietary data be used? If so, describe the permissions obtained to use the data.

-   Who are the potential data users?

-   What is the appropriate timing for release of data to the public or relevant users, and why?

-   When will archived data be openly available to other users?

-   If data from non-GBMF-supported or previous projects are integral to the successful completion of the Grant Purposes, will the non-GBMF-supported and/or pre-existing data also be made freely available?

-   How will other users (i.e., beyond the grantee and GBMF) access data and metadata?

-   Are the publicly available data in raw form? If not, what treatments have been applied to the data prior to their being released to the public?

-   How long beyond the grant term will the data be maintained and by whom?

-   Does the proposed grant include provisions for future hardware upgrades in the event that data is to be stored and maintained well beyond the project period of the Grant?

-   If data analysis tools are to be created as a consequence of the Grant, will a tutorial be available for training of future users of the data, and if so, how can it be accessed?

-   Will a data sharing agreement be required between outside vendors? If so, a brief description of the agreement needs to be provided in the grant proposal.

-   Is a Creative Commons type-license appropriate for sharing the data? Why or why not?

-   How will appropriate attribution to the data provider be provided?

-   Do you anticipate publishing a "Data Release Paper" for referencing and sharing the data?
