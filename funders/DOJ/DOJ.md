Data formats and software standards
-----------------------------------

### Provide information regarding data formats (quantitative/qualitative/spatial) and software with which data will be collected, entered into a database, stored, analyzed and transferred. Standard commercial software or software typically acceptable to NACJD should be identified for use in the proposed data collection.

Each NIJ award that involves data collection includes a special condition requiring the data to be deposited in a public archive at the conclusion of the project. The following items are **required** for deposit in the National Archive of Criminial Justice Data (NACJD):

Data (de-identified) and documentation (as described in each of the following depositing guidelines):

-   [**Guidelines for Depositing NIJ Quantitative Data (PDF)**]

-   [**Guidelines for Depositing NIJ Geospatial Data (PDF)**]

-   [**Guidelines for Depositing NIJ Qualitative Data (PDF)**]

-   Data Archiving Plan

-   IRB approved protocol

-   Privacy Certificate

-   Human Subject Consent form(s)

-   Final Report (for grant awards made prior to Fiscal Year 2014) or journal article (for grant awards after Fiscal Year 2014)

-   [**Data Submission Checklist (PDF)**]

Data collection
---------------

### Describe the procedures by which you plan to collect data along with anticipated units of analysis (e.g., individuals, locations), levels of analysis and other identifiers for each data file submitted upon completion of the funded research; or a description of planned use of existing data, if applicable.

Provide a brief description of the information to be gathered, including the nature, scope, and scale of the data to be produced. This will help reviewers understand the data, their relationship to existing data, and possible disclosure risks.

A thorough review of existing data in related journals and data archives will make clear the value of the proposed research and why currently available datasets are inadequate to answer your research questions.

Describe the formats of the data in the submission, distribution, and preservation phases (note that these formats may be the same). Choosing formats preferred for archiving can make processing and release of data faster and more efficient. Platform-independent and non-proprietary formats will ensure that data will be usable over the long term. Note that when writing the grant proposal, it is useful to think of “data” in the widest sense, including numeric data files, interview transcripts, and other qualitative materials such as diaries and field notes. Increasingly, social science research data include audio and video formats, geospatial data, biomedical data, and Web sites, and many data archives are interested in capturing this broadening array of data.

Archiving and disseminating derived datasets — that is, those resulting from the combination of data from more than one data source, including existing data outside the current research scope — also should be considered.

Privacy and informed consent
----------------------------

### If the proposed research includes collection of information identifiable to private persons, include: a description of all assurances of confidentiality made to those persons; a copy of the consent form that was used; a copy of the Privacy Certificate (as submitted to and approved by the funding agency); documentation of IRB approval and the IRB-approved research protocol; any information transfer agreement that was used to transfer the data with identifiers.

ETHICS AND PRIVACY

If applicable, indicate how you will handle informed consent with respect to informing respondents that the personal information they provide will remain confidential when data are shared or made available for secondary analysis. This may mean describing:

-   • Plans to obtain Institutional Review Board approval

-   • Any legal constraints on sharing data such as HIPAA

-   • Methods of managing disclosure risk

INFORMED CONSENT

Generally speaking, informed consent agreements and confidentiality should be considered as early as possible in the research process. Protection of individuals’ privacy is a core tenet of responsible research practice, and must be thoroughly addressed.

“Informed consent” refers to the communication process that allows individuals to make informed choices about participating in a research study. An informed consent agreement provides required information about the study and serves as a formal agreement by an individual to willingly participate in the proposed research. A description of how participant confidentiality will be protected must be included in an informed consent agreement.

[**(ICPSR Guide to Social Science Data Preparation and Archiving)**]

All fields directly identifying the research subjects must be removed prior to deposit. Therefore, if the data contain direct identifiers and/or contact information, i.e. a roster file with names, addresses, etc., these should be not be deposited. Indirect identifiers may remain in the research data if needed to reproduce the original research findings or if removing them would significantly degrade the value of the research data.

NACJD archiving activities to process data for release include conducting a confidentiality review and using information provided by the depositor to create data files that can be released via the NACJD website and/or through one or more of the options described on our Restricted Data Details page. The Restricted Data options best balance retaining needed analytic information while providing limited and controlled access to the data. Depositors are encouraged to recommend an appropriate level of data access for the data that they deposit.

Depositors can contact NACJD staff with any questions they have about how to prepare the data with confidential content for deposit or to discuss Restricted Data or other options. NACJD staff are available by email at nacjd@icpsr.umich.edu, or by phone at (800) 999-0960.

IP and copyright
----------------

### Describe any intellectual property rights or copyrights associated with the data, data collection instruments or materials.

Indicate who will hold intellectual property rights to the data and other information created by the project, and whether these rights will be transferred to another organization for data distribution and archiving. If any copyrighted material (i.e., instruments or scales) are used, how will the project obtain permission to use or disseminate it?

[**(ICPSR Guide to Social Science Data Preparation and Archiving)**]

Data processing (i)
-------------------

### Describe any anticipated variable creation, data transformations or scale construction that may be critical to the interpretation or analysis of the data by others.

Describe how the data will be managed during the project, including information about version control, naming conventions, etc. Indicating how your data may be different than the norm will help other researchers during secondary analysis. For example, if the data is dynamic, version control would be central to how the data will be used and understood by the research community.

[**(ICPSR Guide to Social Science Data Preparation and Archiving)**]

Data processing (ii)
--------------------

### Include a plan for submission of computer programming code or software syntax providing detail on how the data will be processed, including any significant treatments of the data, such as de-identification, imputation, filtering or weighting.

No guidance is available for this requirement.

Technical documentation
-----------------------

### Describe the technical documentation (e.g., data dictionary or codebook) that explains how variables will be designated and labeled in the data file(s), such as the use of variable naming conventions and variable groups, missing data/value designations, variable and category/value labels, operational definitions, and citations as needed for these variables.

For any study, there are several possible types of documentation files for data collections:

-   **Codebook:** Information on the structure, contents, and layout of a data file. The codebook may also contain information on study design and methodology.

-   **Dictionary file:** Information on column locations and labeling of variables.

-   **Data collection instrument:** Original survey instrument or questionnaire.

-   **Data map:** Similar to a dictionary file.

-   **Errata file:** Errors noted for a particular collection, usually supplied by the principal investigator.

-   **Frequency file:** Frequency of response or descriptive statistics for selected variables in a collection.

-   **Crosstabulation file:** Crosstabulations for some or all variables in a collection.

-   **User Guide:** More detailed information about a particular collection, often provided by the principal investigator.

-   **Manual:** Instructions prepared by the principal investigator on some aspect of the data collection.

-   **Appendices:** Additional documentation.

-   **Reports:** Description of findings or results based on analysis of a dataset. Prepared by the principal investigator.

-   **Record layout file:** Similar to a dictionary file.

-   **Tables/Crosstables:** Similar to frequencies files but presented in tabular format.

The NACJD standard for documentation is Portable Document Format (PDF), and they are moving toward compliance with the PDF/A standard.
