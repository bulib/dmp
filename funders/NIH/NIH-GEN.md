Data sharing plan
-----------------

### Investigators seeking \$500,000 or more in direct costs in any year should include a description of how final research data will be shared, or explain why data sharing is not possible.

The precise content of the data-sharing plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. Consider the following:

-   When will you make the data available?

-   What file formats will you use for your data, and why?

-   What transformations will be necessary to prepare data for preservation/data sharing?

-   What metadata/documentation will be submitted alongside the data?

-   Will a data-sharing agreement will be required? What will the agreement state?

-   What are your plans for providing access to your data?

-   Which archive/repository/central database have you identified as a place to deposit data?

Additional data sharing requirements
------------------------------------

### More stringent data management and sharing requirements may be required in specific NIH Funding Opportunity Announcements. Principal Investigators must discuss how these requirements will be met in their Data Sharing Plans.

Describe here any additional program-specific data management requirements. If none exist you may leave this section blank.

Please note the [**Rigor and Reproducibility**] requirements that involve updates to grant application instructions and review criteria (but not Data Sharing Plans).
