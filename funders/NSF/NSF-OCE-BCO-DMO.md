Data Policy Compliance
----------------------

### Identify any published data policies with which the project will comply, including the NSF OCE Data and Sample Policy as well as other policies that may be relevant if the project is part of a large coordinated research program (e.g. GEOTRACES).

No guidance is available for this requirement.

Pre-Cruise Planning
-------------------

### If the proposed project involves a research cruise, describe the cruise plans. (Skip this section if it is not relevant to your proposal.) Consider the following questions: (1) How will pre-cruise planning be coordinated? (e.g. email, teleconference, workshop) (2) What types of sampling instruments will be deployed on the cruise? (3) How will the cruise event log be recorded? (e.g. the Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) event logger application, an Excel spreadsheet, or paper logs) (4) Will you prepare a cruise report?

If cruise plans are not known at this time, it is appropriate to omit this section or to state that cruise plans will be made at a later date. Funded projects that involve deployments (including research cruises as well as deployments of moorings, floats, and gliders) will be expected to provide deployment metadata to BCO-DMO, along with the project and dataset metadata. Information on how to contribute deployment metadata to BCO-DMO is available on the BCO-DMO website at http://www.bco-dmo.org/how-get-started.

Description of Data Types
-------------------------

### Provide a description of the types of data to be produced during the project. Identify the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, derived models, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project. Include a description of the location of collection, collection methods and instruments, expected dates or duration of collection. If you will be using existing datasets, state this and include how you will obtain them.

It may be useful to group data into four categories:

-   \(1) Observational (e.g. in-situ, collected in the field). Examples may include: shipboard underway data; mesozooplankton samples collected by a net system; copepod specimens collected, identified, and preserved; hydrographic casts; alongtrack data; remote sensing (e.g. ocean color); acoustic data.

-   \(2) Experimental (e.g. generated in a lab or under controlled conditions). Examples: controlled carbonate chemistry experiments; DNA and RNA sequences.

-   \(3) Simulations (e.g. machine-generated). Example: models and their output.

-   \(4) Derived (e.g. synthesized from existing datasets). Examples: compiled database, products, reports.

If the expected dates or duration of collection are not known at this time (e.g. due to funding schedules or ship availability), it is appropriate to give approximations, the ideal dates/duration, or to state that these details will be determined at a later date.

Data and Metadata Formats and Standards
---------------------------------------

### Identify the formats and standards to be used for data and metadata formatting and content. Where existing standards are absent or deemed inadequate, these formats and contents should be documented along with any proposed solutions or remedies. Consider the following questions: (1) Which file formats will be used to store your data? (2) What type of contextual details (metadata) will you document and how? (3) Are there specific data or metadata standards that you will be adhering to? (4) Will you be using or creating a data dictionary, code list, or glossary? (5) What types of quality control will be used? How will data quality be assessed and flagged?

Usually, data served by BCO-DMO are submitted as comma- or tab-separated ASCII files (.csv, .txt) or as spreadsheet files (.xls, .xlsx). However, BCO-DMO is flexible and willing to work with whatever reasonably organized format the investigator uses.

Data Storage and Access During the Project
------------------------------------------

### Describe how project data will be stored, accessed, and shared among project participants during the course of the project. Consider the following: (1) How will data be shared among project participants during the data collection and analysis phases? (e.g. web page, shared network drive) (2) How/where will data be stored and backed-up? (3) If data volumes will be significant, what is the estimated total file size?

No guidance is available for this requirement.

Mechanisms and Policies for Access, Sharing, Re-Use, and Re-Distribution
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Describe mechanisms for data access and sharing, and describe any related policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives. Include provisions for appropriate protections of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements. Consider the following: (1) When will data be made publicly available and how? Identify the data repositories you plan to use to make data available. (2) Are the data sensitive in nature (e.g. endangered species concerns, potential patentability)? If so, is public access inappropriate and how will access be provided? (e.g. formal consent agreements, restricted access) (3) Will any permission restrictions (such as an embargo period) need to be placed on the data? If so, what are the reasons and what is the duration of the embargo? (4) Who holds intellectual property rights to the data and how might this affect data access? (5) Who is likely to be interested in re-using the data? What are the foreseeable re-uses of the data?

Explain how and when data will be made available. Also describe any re-use and re-distribution policies and how the data sharing plans are related to those policies. Identify who will be allowed to use your data and whether or not they will be allowed to disseminate your data. If access to, use of, or dissemination of data will be restricted, explain how you will codify and communicate these restrictions.

Data Sharing via BCO-DMO
------------------------

If the proposal is being submitted to the NSF Division of Ocean Sciences’ (OCE) Biological or Chemical Oceanography Sections or Division of Polar Programs (PLR) Antarctic Sciences (ANT) Organisms & Ecosystems Program, then the two page plan can state that BCO-DMO staff will work with you to manage the data, and that data or model results generated during the proposed research project will be contributed to the BCO-DMO system. BCO-DMO provides data management services at no additional cost to projects funded by these NSF sections/programs.

Project investigators funded by these sections/programs can work with BCO-DMO to make project data available online, in compliance with the NSF OCE Sample and Data Policy. PIs of funded projects will be expected to submit project metadata to BCO-DMO beginning with the award/proposal number and DMP for proposals that are recommended for funding.

BCO-DMO can deal with a wide variety of data, including but not limited to biological, chemical, and physical oceanography measurements. BCO-DMO data managers routinely serve in-situ data including standard hydrographic, biogeochemical, biological, ecological, and microbial measurements and chemical tracers; experimental and model results; images and movies, etc. If you are uncertain if BCO-DMO is an appropriate repository for your data, please contact info@bco-dmo.org.

See Appendices III and IV of the OCE Sample and Data Policy for information on other suggested databases and repositories for physical samples.

Genomic Data and Other Specialized Repositories
-----------------------------------------------

Provisions should be made for the sharing and storage of genetic and molecular data in a publicly accessible, permanent database such as the various NCBI databases (e.g. GenBank), RAST, MG-RAST, etc. Information about the types of data accepted by GenBank is available on their website at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/submit\_types. If known, it’d be helpful to disclose the details and availability of bioinformatics pipelines that will be used in next-generation methods. Accommodations for sharing of metagenome, metatranscriptome, and proteomics data should also be described in the DMP.

BCO-DMO can enable discovery of data that have been contributed to specialized repositories (e.g. NCBI, LTER data catalog, CDIAC). For example, genetic sequence data are best served by an NCBI repository such as GenBank. Metadata and accession numbers/URLs/unique identifiers can then be provided to BCO-DMO so that access to these alternate repositories can be provided through the BCO-DMO website.

Underway Shipboard Data
-----------------------

All routine underway data collected by vessel-resident instrumentation aboard UNOLS-supported oceanographic research vessels will be submitted to the appropriate long-term archive through the Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) program. The PI is responsible for disseminating the data and metadata produced by the science party’s research.

Plans for Archiving
-------------------

### Describe the plans for long-term archiving of data, samples, and other research products, and for preservation of access to them. Consider the following: (1) What is your long-term strategy for maintaining, curating, and archiving the data? (2) What archive(s) have you identified as a place to deposit data and other research products?

After data contributed to BCO-DMO are online and fully documented, BCO-DMO ensures that the data are archived properly at the appropriate National Data Center (e.g. NODC) for long-term archive preservation.

The Rolling Deck to Repository program (R2R) is responsible for archiving routine underway data at the appropriate national archive, including the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC).

See Appendices III and IV of the OCE Sample and Data Policy for information on other suggested databases and repositories for physical samples.

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

### Describe the roles and responsibilities of all parties with respect to the management of the data. Consider the following: (1) If there are multiple investigators involved, what are the data management responsibilities of each person? (2) Who will be the lead or primary person responsible for ultimately ensuring compliance with the Data Management Plan?

No guidance is available for this requirement.
