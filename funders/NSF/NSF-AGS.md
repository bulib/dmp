Products of research
--------------------

### Describe the types of data and products that will be generated in the research, such as physical samples, space and/or time-dependent information on chemical and physical processes, images, spectra, final or intermediate numerical results, theoretical formalisms, computational strategies, software, and curriculum materials.

Describe what data or other research products you will generate in the course of your project. Include the size or amount of data produced, the type of data files that will be generated, and where and when the data will be produced. Examples of research products include observational data, results from models, data generated from previous observations or models, physical samples, software, curriculum materials, etc. Consider the following:

-   What data will be generated in the research?

-   What data types will you be creating or capturing? (e.g. experimental measures, observational or qualitative, model simulation, processed etc.)

-   How will you capture or create the data?

-   If you will be using existing data, state that fact and include where you got it.

-   What is the relationship between the data you are collecting and the existing data?

-   How much data will be produced?

Data format
-----------

### Describe the format in which the data or products are stored (e.g. hardcopy logs and/or instrument outputs, ASCII, XML files, HDF5, CDF, etc). What metadata will be part of the data sets produced?

Describe the format of your data, and think about what details (metadata) someone else would need to be able to use these files. Metadata may entail descriptions of research details such as: experiments, apparatuses, computational codes, etc. Consider these questions:

-   Which file formats will you use for your data, and why?

-   What form will the metadata describing/documenting your data take?

-   How will you create or capture these details?

-   Which metadata standards will you use and why have you chosen them? (e.g. accepted domain-local standards, widespread usage).

-   What contextual details (metadata) are needed to make the data you capture or collect meaningful?

Access to data, and data sharing practices and policies
-------------------------------------------------------

### Describe your plans for providing access to data, including websites maintained by your research group and contributions to public databases. If maintenance of a web site or database is the direct responsibility of your group, provide information about the period of time the web site or database is expected to be maintained. Also describe your practice or policies regarding the release of data&\#8212;for example whether data are available before or after formal publication and the approximate duration of time that the data will be kept private. Describe your policies (where applicable) for protection of propriety data, privacy and confidentiality, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements.

Describe how you will make the data available to other researchers, as well as to the general public. Consider what data will be available (and in what formats) and where (on your website, available via ftp download, via e-mail, or another way). Please keep in mind that you are expected to adequately provide responses for both how you plan on making your data accessible without a specific request from a researcher, and how you will be able to provide data to the public. Make sure to mention how long the data will be kept private before making it available, and if different data products will be available on different schedules (e.g. raw data vs. processed data). Use this section to also explain policies for the protection of proprietary data, issues of privacy and confidentiality, and intellectual property as their impact on the dissemination of your data. *Consider these questions*:

-   How and when will you make the data available?

-   What are your plans for providing access to your data? (on your website, available via ftp download, via e-mail, or another way)

-   What file formats will be used for data sharing?

-   How long will the original data collector/creator/principal investigator retain the right to use the data before opening it up to wider use?

-   How long do you expect to keep the data private before making it available? Explain if different data products will become available on different schedules (Ex: raw data vs processed data, observations vs models, etc.)

-   Are there ethical and privacy issues? If so, how will these be resolved?

-   Who will hold the intellectual property rights to the data and how might this affect data access?

-   If applicable, what have you done to comply with your obligations in your IRB Protocol?

-   How long will/should data be kept beyond the life of the project?

Policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution and production of derivatives
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Describe your policies regarding the use of data provided via general access or sharing. If you plan to provide data on a website, will the site contain disclaimers, or conditions regarding the use of the data in other publications or products? If the data or products are copyrighted, how will this be noted on the website?

Explain how the policies outlined in the previous question can be applied to the re-use and re-distribution of your data. Identify who will be allowed to use your data, how they will be allowed to use your data and whether or not they will be allowed to disseminate your data. If you are planning on restricting access, use or dissemination of the data, you must explain in this section how you will codify and communicate these restrictions. Consider the following:

-   Will any permission restrictions need to be placed on the data?

-   Who is likely to be interested in the data?

-   What and who are the intended or foreseeable uses the data?

Archiving of data
-----------------

### Describe whether and how data will be archived and how preservation of access will be handled. For example, will hardcopy logs, instrument outputs, and physical samples be stored in a location where there are safeguards against fire or water damage? Is there a plan to transfer digitized information to new storage media or devices as technological standards or practices change? Will there be an easily accessible index that documents where all archived data are stored and how they can be accessed? If the data will be archived by a third party, please refer to their preservation plans (if available).

Provide a description of your long-term strategy for archiving and preserving the data you plan to generate/use. **Data that underlie the findings reported in a journal article or conference paper should be deposited in accordance with the policies of the publication and according to the procedures laid out in the DMP included in the proposal that led to the award on which the research is based. All data resulting from the research funded by the award, whether or not the data support a publication, should be deposited at the appropriate repository as explained in the DMP. Rarely does NSF expect that retention of all data that are streamed from an instrument or created in the course of an experiment or survey will be required. See your specific directorate or solicitation for details. There are several technical strategies for achieving long-term preservation including redundancy, dark archives, secure data centers, and so on. In general, good practice calls for duplicating the collection at a geographically distinct location and for regular monitoring and format migration, given exigencies of media degradation and format obsolescence.**Consider the following:

-   What is the long-term strategy for maintaining, curating and archiving the data?

-   Which archive/repository/database have you identified as a place to deposit data?

-   What procedures does your intended long-term data storage facility have in place for preservation and backup?

-   How long will/should data be kept beyond the life of the project?

-   What data will be preserved for the long-term?

-   What transformations will be necessary to prepare data for preservation / data sharing?

-   What metadata/ documentation will be submitted alongside the data or created on deposit/ transformation in order to make the data reusable?

-   What related information will be deposited?
