## Roles and responsibilities

> The Data Management Plan should outline the rights and obligations of all parties as to their roles and responsibilities in the management and retention of research data. It must also consider changes to roles and responsibilities that will occur should a principal investigator or co-PI leave the institution.

The primary responsibility for managing the data will belong to the PI, Lizabeth Schlemer. If the PI is not available, both Linda Vanasupa and Aaron Estrada will be able to access the data and continue to management. It is the goal to house the data in the Digital Commons at Cal Poly. The data will be uploaded at the completion of the grant and then theresponsibility for the information will be transferred to the Library. Any data not deemed public will be keep on the computer belong into the PI, which is backed up periodically.


## Expected data

> The Data Management Plan should describe the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project. It should then describe the expected types of data to be retained. 

The data for this project will include 60 interviews with Engineering Faculty and a set of survey data . The interviews will be stored with both audio files and transcribed text files. The surveys will be store in excel spread sheets and include survey answers and demographic information. Transcribed text will be verified to the audio files. No fewer than two copies of the data will be kept at all times and will be located in different locations. In addition, data for public access will be anonymized and stripped of identifying information. This process anonymizing will be documented.


## Period of data retention

> The Data Management Plan should describe the period of data retention. Minimum data retention of research data is three years after conclusion of the award or three years after public release, whichever is later. Public release of data should be at the earliest reasonable time. A reasonable standard of timeliness is to make the data accessible immediately after publication, where submission for publication is also expected to be timely. Exceptions requiring longer retention periods may occur when data supports patents, when questions arise from inquiries or investigations with respect to research, or when a student is involved, requiring data to be retained a timely period after the degree is awarded. Research data that support patents should be retained for the entire term of the patent. Longer retention periods may also be necessary when data represents a large collection that is widely useful to the research community. For example, special circumstances arise from the collection and analysis of large, longitudinal data sets that may require retention for more than three years. Project data-retention and data-sharing policies should account for these needs. 

The data will be available for a 10 year period after completion of the grant.


## Data formats and metadata

> The Data Management Plan should describe the specific data formats, media, including any metadata.

There will be three file types: Audio, Text and Spreadsheet. For each of these we will include an ID for the individual interviewed along with date, location, file size and level of anonymization that occurred (for public files). We will create a naming system for the files that will indicate the meta data. For files uploaded to Digital Commons we will include a complete descriptor with the file.


## Data dissemination and policies for public access, sharing and publication delays

> The Data Management Plan should clearly articulate how "sharing of primary data" is to be implemented. It should describe dissemination approaches that will be used to make data available to others.Policies for public access and sharing should be described, including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements. Research centers and major partnerships with industry or other user communities must also address how data are to be shared and managed with partners, center members, and other major stakeholders. Publication delay policies (if applicable) must be clearly stated. Investigators are expected to submit significant findings for publication quickly that are consistent with the publication delay obligations of key partners, such as industrial members of a research center. 

It is the goal to house the data in the Digital Commons at Cal Poly. The data will be uploaded at the completion of the grant. The individual&rsquo;s privacy will be insured by removing any identifiable information. The data will be publicly available through Cal Poly&rsquo;s Digital Commons and through our research website. The access to the data will comply with the IRB requirements. Although we will publish findings based on the data, it is hoped that the data will be a rich source of inquiry for anyone interested in educational research. We only request attribution in the use of the data.


## Data storage and preservation of access

> The DMP should describe physical and cyber resources and facilities that will be used for the effective preservation and storage of research data. In collaborative proposals or proposals involving sub-awards, the lead PI is responsible for assuring data storage and access.

The data will be housed long term on Cal Poly' Digital Commons with all the guarantees afforded data curation on our campus. It is hoped the data will be kept for 10 years after completion of the research.
