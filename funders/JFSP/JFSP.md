Project Data Management: Data Types
-----------------------------------

### Describe the data types, scales, resolution, and formats produced by the project; distinguish between newly collected data and data being re-used from other projects. Describe the actual observations and generated data to be submitted to a data repository, including the resolution of measurement and format of the data. Refer to the methods section of the proposal as necessary.

Give a short description of your data, including types, scale, resolution, format, amount and content. Be as specific as possible. Data types could include text, spreadsheets, images, 3D models, software, audio files, video files, reports, surveys, etc. Describe your actual observations and the data that will be submitted to a data repository. *Consider these questions*:

-   What data will be generated in the research?

-   What data types will you be creating or capturing?

-   How will you capture or create the data?

-   If you will be using existing data, state that fact and include where you got it.

-   What is the relationship between the data you are collecting and the existing data?

-   What data will be preserved and shared?

Project Data Management: Quality Assurance
------------------------------------------

### Describe the steps that will be used to process and quality assure the data. Describe the procedures planned for data proofing and validation, including data collection, entry, transmission, and storage. Describe any descriptive or analytical statistics that will be run on the data for quality assurance.

Think about the steps you will take to ensure the quality of your data. Describe the procedures you will use to proof and validate your data throughout all phases of your project. Describe any analytical tools used. *Consider this question*:

-   What criteria will you use for Quality Assurance/Management (e.g. documentation, calibration, validation, monitoring, transcription, metadata, and peer-review?)

Project Data Management: Data Access
------------------------------------

### Describe your plans for data access and any necessary limitations to protect sensitive data.

Data security is very important. Think about the type(s) of data you are generating; how will you manage data entry and editing? If the data is of a sensitive nature—human subject concerns, species/ecological endangerment concerns—and data access should be regulated, address here the means by which granular control and access will be achieved (e.g. PI access only, restricted access, only available within a secure network, data editing rights/permissions, etc.). *Consider these questions*:

-   How will you manage internal access restrictions and data security during the project’s lifetime?

-   How will you implement permissions and restrictions?

-   Are there ethical and privacy issues? If so, how will these be resolved?

-   What have you done to comply with your obligations in your IRB Protocol?

Project Data Management: Storage and Backup
-------------------------------------------

### Describe your plans for short-term data storage and backup. Describe where and how data will be stored during the project’s duration and how those data will be backed up.

Describe how your research will be stored while you are actively working with and collecting data, including a description of the media. Make sure to include information on how you plan to back-up your data and make redundant copies. *Consider these questions*:

-   Where (physically) will you store the data?

-   On what media will you store the data?

-   Who is responsible for the storage and backup of the project's data?

-   How will you back-up the data during the project's lifetime?

-   How regularly will back-ups be made?

Long-Term Data Management: Metadata
-----------------------------------

### Specify the metadata language you plan to use to describe the data. All associated metadata must be documented in a standard metadata language appropriate to the type of data.

Identify the metadata language you will use for your data. JFSP requires that spatial data sets be documented using either the FGDC version 2.0 or the ISO 19115 metadata standard. The Biological Data Profile standard (associated with FGDC) is very useful for creating documentation of field- and lab-based work. JFSP recommends use of a metadata documentation tool, e.g., Metavist (<http://nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/2737>). Remember: As required by JFSP policy, a copy of your metadata document(s) must be deposited with the Fire Science Research Data Archive to provide a complete JFSP metadata catalog. *Consider these questions*:

-   Which metadata standards will you use? If they are different than specified above justify why have you chosen them?

-   If metadata creation will be automated, which metadata documentation tool(s) will you use?

-   What form will the metadata describing/documenting your data take?

-   What contextual details (metadata) are needed to make the data you capture or collect meaningful?

Long-Term Data Management: Data Repository
------------------------------------------

### Specify the data repository you plan to use for long-term data storage and access. Identify the specific data repository (ies) intended for long-term data storage and access.

Identify the data repository you plan to use for long-term storage. *If you don’t use the JFSP-recommended repository (Forest Service Research Data Archive), then make sure your response answers the following questions*:

-   Which archive/repository/database have you identified as a place to deposit data?

-   What is the stability of the archive and its sponsoring organization(s)?

-   What procedures does your intended long-term data storage facility have in place for preservation and backup?

-   Does the repository maintain data over time in scientist-accessible formats?

-   Does the repository share its catalog with other catalogs?

-   Does the repository ensure access with a PURL?

-   Does the repository provide assistance in metadata creation for your data and related content, and usage statistics?

-   Does the repository assign your data a DOI?

Long-Term Data Management: Data Access
--------------------------------------

### Describe your plans for data access and any necessary limitations to protect sensitive data. Describe the provisions under which these data will be made available, including timing of data release, protection of privacy, confidentiality, intellectual property rights, or other sensitive data issues (e.g., location of endangered species).

The main reason a Data Management Plan is required is for you to think about how you prepare (manage) your data for sharing and how you will actively share your data with others during and after the project is completed. *Consider these questions*:

-   How will you make the data available? (Include resources needed to make the data available: documentation, equipment, systems, expertise, etc.)

-   What transformations will be necessary to prepare data for preservation / data sharing?

-   When will you make the data available?

-   What is the process for gaining access to the data?

-   How long will the original data collector/creator/principal investigator retain the right to use the data before making them available for wider distribution?

-   Are there any embargo periods for political/commercial/patent reasons? If so, give details.

-   Will any permission restrictions need to be placed on the data?

-   Will you include links to published materials and outcomes?

-   Will you include a citation link for data re-users?
