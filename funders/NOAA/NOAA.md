Type of data and information created
------------------------------------

### Describe the types of environmental data and information created during the course of the project

Environmental Data are recorded and derived observations and measurements of the physical, chemical, biological, geological, and geophysical properties and conditions of the oceans, atmosphere, space environment, sun, and solid earth, as well as correlative data, such as socio-economic data, related documentation, and metadata. Media, including voice recordings and photographs, may be included. In this section also include the type of collection method, aircraft, ship, satellite, etc.; Data-sharing plans should encompass all data from funded research that can be shared without compromising individual subjects' rights and privacy, regardless of whether the data have been used in a publication. Furthermore, data sharing prior to the publication of major results is encouraged in many instances, for example, when data are collected to provide a resource for the scientific community (as in the case of many large surveys). *Consider these questions*:

-   • What data will you collect or create in the research

-   • What data types will you be creating or capturing?

-   • How will you capture or create the data?

-   • If you will be using existing data, state that fact and include where you got it.

-   • What is the relationship between the data you are collecting and the existing data?

Expected schedule for data sharing
----------------------------------

### Tentative date by which the data will be shared

Environmental Data must be shared in a timely manner. Sharing data refers to making data visible, accessible, and independently understandable to users in a timely manner at minimal cost to users, except where limited by law, regulation, policy or by security requirements. In general, data that have potential usefulness to others are expected to be made available as soon as possible consistent with logistical considerations. Data from small studies can be analyzed and ready for publication and sharing relatively quickly. If data from large studies are collected over several discrete time periods or waves, data should be released in waves as they become available or main findings from waves of the data are published. NOAA recognizes that the investigators who collected the data have a legitimate interest in benefiting from their investment of time and effort. NOAA continues to expect that the initial investigators may benefit from being the first user of the data, but not from prolonged or indefinite exclusive use. Unless otherwise indicated in the FFO, data must be shared no later than 2-years after the date of observation. *Consider these questions:*

-   • How long will the original data collector/creator/principal investigator retain the right to use the data before opening it up to wider use?

-   • How long do you expect to keep the data private before making it available? Explain if different data products will become available on different schedules (Ex: raw data vs processed data, observations vs models, etc.)

-   • Explain details of any embargo periods for political/commercial/patent reasons?

-   • When will you make the data available?

Standards for format and content
--------------------------------

### Describe the standards to be used for data/metadata format and content

Describe the format of your data. Ideally, data formats will be chosen that are openly and freely available, and/or non-proprietary in nature. The data must be accompanied with documentation, metadata and, if needed, tools to read the data that allow a user to interpret the data properly. Documentation and metadata should clearly indicate the status of the dataset (initial raw data, draft data with only rudimentary quality controls, partial dataset, final data, etc). *Consider these questions:*

-   • Which file formats will you use for your data, and why?

-   • What file formats will be used for data sharing?

-   • What metadata/ documentation will be submitted alongside the data or created on deposit/ transformation in order to make the data reusable?

-   • What contextual details (metadata) are needed to make the data you capture or collect meaningful?

-   • How will you create or capture these details?

-   • What form will the metadata describing/documenting your data take?

-   • Which metadata standards will you use and why have you chosen them? (e.g. accepted domain-local standards, widespread usage)

Polices for stewardship and preservation
----------------------------------------

### Describe your programs policies that address data stewardship and preservation

NOAA facilities that archive data and make the data openly available should be considered first for the disposition of the data. The process to contact a NOAA archive regarding a data stream is described in the [NOAA Procedure for Scientific Records Appraisal and Archive Approval]. *Consider these questions:*

-   • What is the long-term strategy for maintaining, curating and archiving the data?

-   • Which archive/repository/database have you identified as a place to deposit data?

-   • What procedures does your intended long-term data storage facility have in place for preservation and backup?

-   • How long will/should data be kept beyond the life of the project?

-   • What data will be preserved for the long-term?

-   • What transformations will be necessary to prepare data for preservation / data sharing?

-   • What metadata/ documentation will be submitted alongside the data or created on deposit/ transformation in order to make the data reusable?

-   • What related information will be deposited?

Procedures for providing access
-------------------------------

### Describe the procedures for proving access, sharing and security

Data sharing can be accomplished through:

-   1\. Data Archive: place where data are acquired, manipulated, documented, and distributed. NOAA facilities that archive data and make the data openly available should be considered.

-   2\. Data Enclave: controlled, secure environment in which eligible researchers can perform analyses using data resources

-   3\. Publishing: articles in scientific publications

-   4\. Researcher’s Efforts: investigator responds directly to data requests (e.g., posting data on a Web site)

Policies applicable to protection of personally identifiable information, critical infrastructure information or proprietary trade information as well as regulations related to export control may impact your ability to share data, among other items. Your data-sharing plans could indicate the criteria for deciding who can receive your data and whether or not you will place any conditions on their use. Data should be made as widely and freely available as possible while safeguarding the confidentiality of the data and privacy of participants. You should not place limits on the questions or methods others might pursue nor should you require co-authorship as a condition for receiving the data. *Consider these questions:*

-   • What are your plans for providing access to your data? (on your website, available via ftp download, via e-mail, or another way)

-   • Will any permission restrictions need to be placed on the data?

-   • With whom will you share the data, and under what conditions?

-   • Will a data sharing agreement be required?

-   • Are there ethical and privacy issues? If so, how will these be resolved?

-   • Who will hold the intellectual property rights to the data and how might this affect data access?

Previous published data
-----------------------

### Describe your prior experience in publishing research data

If you have previously published research data, list the citations here (including the website or persistent identifier).
