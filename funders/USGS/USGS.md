Backup/Secure and Preserve
--------------------------

### Backup/Secure and Preserve elements of the USGS Science Data Lifecycle: Backup/Secure involves managing risks and accessibility to the data throughout the lifecycle. Preserve highlights important activities that should be taken to ensure long-term preservation of data, metadata, ancillary products, and additional documentation.

Consider these topics and questions:

• Where will the data be stored in the short-term? Is it properly secured and environmentally controlled?

• What will be the approach for routine backup of the data (frequency, duration, software, media)? Will the data be stored in multiple places and on different media types (recommended minimum of 3 copies with 1 stored in an offsite location)?

• Describe any potential access restrictions such as the data contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and any practices to ensure access will be restricted.

• What will be the final format of the data product and will there be any software needs? Will the data format be appropriate for long-term preservation?

• Where will the data and metadata be preserved in the long-term and by which sponsoring Program (if in collaboration)? Who will be the point of contact?

• If costs are associated with long-term storage, how will they be provided for?

Publish and Share
-----------------

### Publish and Share elements of the USGS Science Data Lifecycle: Publish and Share highlight important considerations related to traditional peer-reviewed publications and dissemination of the data through Web sites, data catalogs, social media and other outlets.

Consider these topics and questions:

• How will the data itself be shared and made available to the public (e.g. web page, tool or application, data portal, repository, USGS Data Series)? Are there data release policies that need to be followed?

• Will there be access or use restrictions on the data (e.g. sensitive data, restricted data, privacy, software with license restrictions, etc.)? Provide justification for the restriction citing any policies or legal reasons.

• How can someone overcome these restrictions (e.g. fees, non-disclosure statements, special authorization, data embargo or hold, MOUs/MOAs)?

• Identify any anticipated publications or electronic outlets (e.g. peer-reviewed articles, information/fact sheets, web pages) resulting from the data. If a USGS publication, indicate type (e.g. Open File Report, Provisional Release etc).

• Where will your metadata be stored to provide an access point for discovery by users and harvest by catalogs such as the USGS Science Data Catalog?

• How and where will you obtain a persistent identifier for the data (e.g. digital object identifier)?
