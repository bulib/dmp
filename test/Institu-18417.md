## Roles and responsibilities

> Roles and responsibilities of project or institutional staff in the management and retention of research data

There will be two researchers on this project. The first is University of New Mexico graduate student Stephanie Gurule Smith, with assistance from her Academic Advisor, Dr. Glenabah Martinez in the Department of Language, Literacy and Sociocultural Studies.

Stephanie Smith has recieved training in Research Ethics, as well as different courses in educational research statistics, and she will be the main person conducting the research, comparing the statistics, formatting and submitting the report. Dr. Martinez will be in a supportive, guiding and editorial role.

Ms. Smith plans on making her comparative research and report findings public, and will store them on the University of New Mexico - Lobo Vault website. The University will then be responsible for monitoring and updating the Lobo Vault to keep the report viewable to the public.

Adherance to this data management plan will be initially checked by Dr. Martinez, but will be sporatically monitored by Ms. Smith after submission. Ms. Smith will be responsible for the report once the original personnel from University of New Mexico are no longer available.


## Type of data and format to be shared

> The DSP (Data Sharing Plan) should describe the types of data to be produced in the course of the project and shared. It should then describe the expected formats of the final dataset

The data I collect will initially be similar research from Germany and America. I will collect this from the UNM research data base and will probably come mostly from Education Policy Journals. These should not need long-term storage, since they are already stored and are accessible elsewhere.

I then plan to start collecting my own data on New Mexico high school graduates. I will store most of this data initially in an Xcel document which will be stored on hard drives at the UNM. It may include audio or video files and surveys. It may also contain student data like report cards.

Once I have the complete report done, I will store the research information that I collected on a portable hard drive at home, while the research report is stored on LoboVault.


## Documentation to be provided

> Documentation that provides all the information necessary for other researchers to use the data must be prepared 

I plan to use eXcel worksheets to store my data. I do not plan on having extremely large sample sizes, perhaps 20 people, so I should not need metadata programs to store the data.

This will be a qualitative study, so there will not be many actual figures to compute, store or access later. I will compute the percentages and those will be available within the report with no separate file with metadata stored.


## Confidentiality of data 

> Procedures for managing and for maintaining the confidentiality of the data to be shared

My study will be of a sensitive nature because I will be studying humans. I will ensure that study participants over the age of eighteen. I will keep any identifiying information which links them to certain statistics within the report on scratch paper at my house and not on any sort of computer file. I will change all names stated in the report and only identify their gender and how long it took them to find work after graduation. All of my information collected will be highly confidential and I will take every precaution to make sure it is free of indentifiers linking to individuals I interviewed. The research data will be on an excel sheet with a number for the participant, gender, age, and their employment or school status.

I will gain consent from the individuals for data preservation and sharing, and will apply throught the University of New Mexico IRB dept. before beginning my research interviews.


## Expected schedule for data sharing 

> Timely data sharing is important to the scientific process. IES thus expects that data will be shared no later than when the main findings from the final study dataset are published.

There should be no delay in sharing data, as none of the data will be proprietary.

The data from the interviewees will always be available, but their actual identities will never be available for wider use.


## Method of data sharing

> Method of data sharing (e.g., provided by the Principal Investigator, through a data archive)

To share my research, I plan on applying to different education policy journals. Whether or not I am able to get published, I plan on storing the actual research report on the University of New Mexico LoboVault, which is a data archive accessible to the public.


## Data sharing agreement

> Discuss whether or not a data sharing agreement that specifies conditions under which the data will be shared is required.

I don't believe that any permission restrictions need to be placed on the data because there is no need within the report to link research participants with certain outcomes.


## Circumstances that prevent sharing

> Discuss any circumstances that prevent all or some of the data from being shared. This includes data that may fall under multiple statutes and, hence, must meet the confidentiality requirements for each applicable statute  (e.g., data covered by Common Rule for Protection of Human Subjects, FERPA and HIPAA).

There should be no circumstances which will prevent the report from being shared. Individuals will be high school graduate adults from different school districts, so there should be no institutional, proprietary, or minor policies that would hinder it from completely public publishing.
