## Data sharing plan

> Investigators seeking $500,000 or more in direct costs in any year should include a description of how final research data will be shared, or explain why data sharing is not possible.



The data products will be generated twice during this project. We will produce a test version of the data around the start of the project in the piloting phase of the study and a final version at the end of the project.The test version will be made available to the research team for evaluation and the final version archived for long term data management. During the course of the project we will generate daily back ups of the data files that will be retained by the Principal Investigator in a secured office locker. The whole process will take 6 months and after the analysis the data will be availed to the public at the University of Nairobi digital repository (erepository.uonbi.ac.ke) .The data sharing agreement states that any parties in need of such data can access it with compliance to copyright laws.




## Additional data sharing requirements

> More stringent data management and sharing requirements may be required in specific NIH Funding Opportunity Announcements. Principal Investigators must discuss how these requirements will be met in their Data Sharing Plans.

Data available for sharing will include the medical history. Indiviual data sets will not be available but the whole data set will be availed for scrutiny. Data collected will be reviewed every other day by the Principal investigator for adequate quality control and the public will be able to access some of the data collected based on the discretion of the research team at the end of the project. This data can be shared with other statistical tools such as the Statistical Package for Social Scientists(SPSS) and SAS.
