## Roles and responsibilities

> The Data Management Plan should outline the rights and obligations of all parties with respect to their roles and responsibilities in the management and retention of research data. It should also consider changes to roles and responsibilities that will occur should a project director or co-project director leave the institution or project.

This research will be conducted in time frame of two months from may to end of august 2015.

The head of the research team will choose a team of ten people who will carry out the research through data collection and analyzing. This team will be trained in a period of two weeks.

The head of the team will manage and monitor the data management plan. T

he research is likely to receive funds from EUA Government, this includes training cost, payment to the workers and other charges.


## Expected data

> The Data Management Plan should describe the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project. It should then describe the expected types of data to be retained.

Type of Data: Open Source computer code associated with tool, interface, and server-side components development.

When Shared: At conclusion of the start-up project, when initial testing has been completed.

Under What Conditions:Code will be freely available.



Type of Data: User-generated texts, annotations, and electronic multi-media collections generated during the testing phase.

When Shared:None of these data will be publically available until the conclusion of the start-up project.

Under What Conditions:These data will be made available at the discretion of the creator, who will control access via privacy settings.

Copyrighted data will be dynamically excluded from collections and documents made available to the public. 



Type of Data:Assessment data generated during the testing phase.

When Shared: Aggregated data will be shared via the white paper and final report to NEH.

Under What Condition:No information will be shared that could identify individuals participating in the assessment process.



Type of Data: A final report to Government of EUA.

When shared: At the conclusion of the project.

Under what conditions: Dissemination of the final report will be the responsibility of Government of EUA.


## Period of data retention

> NEH is committed to timely and rapid data distribution. However, it recognizes that types of data can vary widely and that acceptable norms also vary by discipline. It is strongly committed, however, to the underlying principle of timely access. In their DMP applicants should address how timely access will be assured.

Data will be available immediately following processing, quality assurance and documentation by our team.

Data will be retained for 5 years beyond the completion of the start-up phase and aggregated data will be publicly available within 1 year of project completion,via the project website, copies of the data will be stored long-term in DSpace@MIT. http://dspace.mit.edu/


## Data formats and dissemination

> The Data Management Plan should describe data formats, media, and dissemination approaches that will be used to make data and metadata available to others. Policies for public access and sharing should be described, including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements. Research centers and major partnerships with industry or other user communities must also address how data are to be shared and managed with partners, center members, and other major stakeholders.

We will employ comma separated .csv formats that are easily imported to Matlab, Excel, SAS and similar statistical software.

Metadata will be provided in pdf form to preserve content integrity.


## Data storage and preservation of access

> The Data Management Plan should describe physical and cyber resources and facilities that will be used for the effective preservation and storage of research data. These can include third party facilities and repositories."

All computer code will be stored in Github. https://github.com/.

All other data, including user generated texts and annotations, (exportable as TEI/XML files), assessment data, reports, and publications will be stored in DSpace, MIT&rsquo;s online institutional repository for faculty and researchers.

Copyrightcleared media documents will be stored in DSpace along with their respective collection and student interaction information. DSpace@MIT identifies two levels of digital preservation: bit preservation, and functional preservation. Bit preservation ensures that a file remains exactly the same over time &ndash; not a single bit is changed &ndash; while the physical media evolve around it. Functional preservation goes further: the file does change over time so that the material continues to be immediately usable in the same way it was originally while the digital formats (and the physical media) evolve over time. DSpace@MIT insures permanent data preservation in a secure and searchable archive, and is managed by MIT Libraries.
