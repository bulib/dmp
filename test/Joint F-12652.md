## Project Data Management: Data Types

> Describe the data types, scales, resolution, and formats produced by the project; distinguish between newly collected data and data being re-used from other projects. Describe the actual observations and generated data to be submitted to a data repository, including the resolution of measurement and format of the data. Refer to the methods section of the proposal as necessary.

Field sample collections of vegetation height and percent coverage. Fuel load biomass clippings. Running a multiple linear regression to evaluate if there is a relationship between my independent variables of vegetation height, percent coverage of green vegetation, and fuel load.


## Project Data Management: Quality Assurance

> Describe the steps that will be used to process and quality assure the data.  Describe the procedures planned for data proofing and validation, including data collection, entry, transmission, and storage. Describe any descriptive or analytical statistics that will be run on the data for quality assurance.

All measurements will be recorded using paper and pen then transferred to an electronic format on Excel. Data points will be proof read after transcription to ensure no errors were made by both the transcriber and a peer. Hard copies of the data, both the original and Excel copies will be made and stored in principal investigators office.


## Project Data Management: Data Access

> Describe your plans for data access and any necessary limitations to protect sensitive data.  

Data will be publicly available, but the editing rights will be granted only to the PI


## Project Data Management: Storage and Backup

> Describe your plans for short-term data storage and backup. Describe where and how data will be stored during the projectâ€™s duration and how those data will be backed up.

The data will be physically stored in the office of the PI. Electronic copies will be saved on a University computer with back up copies stored in two seperate folders. The data will also be stored on a portable flash drive and an online storage bank only accessable by the PI. Backups will be made each time an edit has been made to the data. The PI is responsible for the storage and backup of the project data.


## Long-Term Data Management: Metadata

> Specify the metadata language you plan to use to describe the data. All associated metadata must be documented in a standard metadata language appropriate to the type of data. 

I will use the FGDC 2.0 and Biological Data Profile standards. Metadata will be created using Metavist and be saved as an XML document.


## Long-Term Data Management: Data Repository

> Specify the data repository you plan to use for long-term data storage and access. Identify the specific data repository (ies) intended for long-term data storage and access.

Forest Service Research Data Archive


## Long-Term Data Management: Data Access

> Describe your plans for data access and any necessary limitations to protect sensitive data.  Describe the provisions under which these data will be made available, including timing of data release, protection of privacy, confidentiality, intellectual property rights, or other sensitive data issues (e.g., location of endangered species).

Data will become available to the public upon completion of the Joint Fire Science Program requirements.
