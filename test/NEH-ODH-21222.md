## Roles and responsibilities

> The Data Management Plan should outline the rights and obligations of all parties with respect to their roles and responsibilities in the management and retention of research data. It should also consider changes to roles and responsibilities that will occur should a project director or co-project director leave the institution or project.

No worries: I will take care of everything, and all will be happy.

On second thoughts, who can be happy when one understands that data are eternal but human understanding is transient.


## Expected data

> The Data Management Plan should describe the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project. It should then describe the expected types of data to be retained.

Lots of data -- we'll play it by ear.


## Period of data retention

> NEH is committed to timely and rapid data distribution. However, it recognizes that types of data can vary widely and that acceptable norms also vary by discipline. It is strongly committed, however, to the underlying principle of timely access. In their DMP applicants should address how timely access will be assured.

Ad hoc policies.


## Data formats and dissemination

> The Data Management Plan should describe data formats, media, and dissemination approaches that will be used to make data and metadata available to others. Policies for public access and sharing should be described, including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements. Research centers and major partnerships with industry or other user communities must also address how data are to be shared and managed with partners, center members, and other major stakeholders.

XML -- need I say more?


## Data storage and preservation of access

> The Data Management Plan should describe physical and cyber resources and facilities that will be used for the effective preservation and storage of research data. These can include third party facilities and repositories."

The CDL is my go to repo.
