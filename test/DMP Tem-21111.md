## Data Types, Formats, Standards and Capture Methods

> Example funder prompts: 
What data outputs will your research generate? Outline volume, type, content, quality and format of the final dataset

Outline the metadata, documentation or other supporting material that should accompany the data for it to be interpreted correctly.

What standards and methodologies will be utilised for data collection and management?

State the relationship to other data available in public repositories e.g. existing data sources that will be used by the research project; gaps between available data and that required for the research; the added value that new data would provide in relation to existing data.

The format for the bald eagle data set is designed so the the general public can access this information. Students and researchers alike can use this to help identidy trends in the bald eagle population. Researchers can use volunteers who can help find bald eagle breeding areas and new nests to be recorded and observed.


## Ethics and Intellectual Property

> Example funder prompts:

Demonstrate that you have sought advice on and addressed all copyright and rights management issues that apply to the resource.

Make explicit mention of consent, confidentiality, anonymisation and other ethical considerations, where appropriate.

Are any restrictions on data sharing required â€“ for example to safeguard research participants or to gain appropriate intellectual property protection?

The funding and data ownership comes from The University of Tennessee. This is a public university and allows this information to be access for free on an open source database. DataOne will store the research and allow users to access this for their own knowledge. The proper citation will be used when referencing this information at the bottom of the data set. Third parties can use this information and contact information will be provided or questions or comments.


## Access, Data Sharing and Reuse

> Example funder prompts:

What are the further intended and/or foreseeable research uses for the completed dataset(s)?

How you will make the resource accessible to the potential audience(s) identified? Where will you make the data available? How will other researchers be able to access the data? Will a data sharing agreement be required? What is the timescale for public release of the data?

State any expected difficulties in data sharing, along with causes and possible measures to overcome these difficulties.

How will data sharing provide opportunities for coordination or collaboration?

Education institutions can provide free access for the students to research and educate about the bald eagle population at Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee. There will be encouragement for schools to include this study in lesson plans and the DataOne database will make this possbile as the data repostitory for the data set.


## Short-Term Storage and Data Management

> Example funder prompts: 

Describe the planned quality assurance and back-up procedures [security/storage].

Specify the responsibilities for data management and curation within research teams at all participating institutions.

The research team enters the data on the excel sheet from a recorded field notebook. Each researcher is required to double check all work and check the work of the other members on the team. This will prevent errors and quality assurance. Each researcher will have two copies of the information backed up on their computers. The final data set will be backed up on all computers including the lab computer and external hard drive.




## Deposit and Long-Term Preservation

> Example funder prompts:

Identify which of the data sets produced are considered to be of long-term value.

Outline the plans for preparing and documenting data for preservation and sharing.

Explain your archiving/preservation plan to ensure the long-term value of key datasets.

For long term storage the data set will be uploaded to the DataOne open source database and checked every 6 months and as need for updates and to reach out to comments and questions from teh public.


## Resourcing

> Example prompts:

What resources will you require to deliver your plan?

Outline additional hardware, software and technical expertise, support and training that is likely to be required and how it will be acquired.

The public will properly cite the researching institute for refrence and the Univeristy of Tennessee. This citation will be provided at the end of the document. The information can be shared with proper reference and citation. There will be a link present that can link back to the reseach organization and funding agency.
